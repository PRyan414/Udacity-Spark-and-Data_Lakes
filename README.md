## STEDI Human Balance Analytics - Course 4 Project - AWS Nanodegree

This project is a demonstration of copying data to storage locations in AWS (S3), creating Glue tables in Glue Studio and querying that data using AWS Athena.

Landing or raw-data tables are transformed and stored in trusted zones to remove PII (personally identifiable information) and joined with other tables for specific purposes, such as machine learning (machine_learning_curated) or customer specific information (customer_curated).

Python and sql scripts are provided along with screenshots of selected tables / queries in Athena.
